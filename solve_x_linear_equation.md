### Problem:
Find $x \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $x + 7 = 9$.

### Method 1:
1. Start with the given equation: $ x + 7 = 9 $
2. Because of real numbers' transitivity on addition and subtraction, subtract 7 from both sides of the equation to isolate $ x $: 
   \[ x + 7 - 7 = 9 - 7 \]
3. Simplify both sides: 
   \[ x + 0 = 2 \]
4. Thus, we have: 
   \[ x = 2 \]

### Method 2:
1. Begin with the given equation: $ x + 7 = 9 $
2. Because of real numbers' transitivity on addition and subtraction, subtract 9 from both sides of the equation to isolate $ x $: 
   \[ x + 7 - 9 = 9 - 9 \]
3. Simplify the left side: 
   \[ x - 2 = 0 \]
4. From $ x - 2 = 0 $, $ x = 2 $ because 2 and -2 are additive inverses. 

### Verification:
To ensure the solution is correct, substitute $ x = 2 $ back into the original equation: 
\[ 2 + 7 = 9 \]

Since the equation holds true, the solution $ x = 2 $ is verified.
